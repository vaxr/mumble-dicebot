Dependcies: A protobuf implementation for Ruby,
  such as  "ruby_protobuf" (0.4.11)
  OR       "protobuf" (1.4.2)


WARNING: The script has not been tested with other protobuf
implementations. In case it fails to work with yours, run rprotoc over
Mumble.proto and replace msg.rb with the resulting file.



Developed for Ruby 1.9.3.


For the parameter list, run  $ mumble-dicebot -h

As of now, the script has to be aborted manually (CTRL-C). This should
automatically disconnect the bot. (Otherwise, the server will kick it
after half a minute or so of ping silence.)
